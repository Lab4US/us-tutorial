    "# Physics of Ultrasound Imaging: Scattering and Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explores the two fundamental physical processes that govern how ultrasound images are formed: **Scattering** (tissue interaction) and **Convolution** (system processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scattering (Dispersion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scattering is the physical phenomenon responsible for the internal \"texture\" (parenchyma) of organs seen in an ultrasound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "* **Definition**: Scattering occurs when sound waves encounter structures with dimensions equal to or smaller than the wavelength ($\\lambda$), or irregular interfaces. Energy is dispersed in multiple directions rather than reflected as a single echo.\n",
    "* **Diffuse Scattering**: Occurs on rough surfaces. It is crucial because it ensures signal returns to the transducer regardless of the beam's angle.\n",
    "* **Rayleigh Scattering**: A specific type occurring with microscopic structures like red blood cells. The intensity increases with the fourth power of frequency ($f^4$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Result: Speckle**\n",
    "> The grainy appearance of ultrasound images is called \"speckle.\" It is not electronic noise but the result of constructive and destructive interference of thousands of small scattered signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Point Spread Function (PSF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before understanding convolution, we must define the **PSF**:\n",
    "* It represents the system's response to a single, ideal point scatterer.\n",
    "* Since a transducer cannot produce an infinitesimal point, it creates a \"blur\" or \"spot\" characterized by **length** (pulse duration) and **width** (beam focusing).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution (Image Formation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolution** is the mathematical model describing how the physical ultrasound pulse interacts with human tissue to create the final image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Model\n",
    "The final image $I(z)$ is the convolution of the tissue's scattering map $T(z)$ and the system's $PSF(z)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(z) = T(z) * PSF(z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact on Image Quality\n",
    "| Feature | Dependency |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Blurring** | Larger PSFs cause more \"smearing\" of tissue details. |\n",
    "| **Axial Resolution** | Improved by higher frequencies (shorter pulses/PSF). |\n",
    "| **Lateral Resolution** | Improved by narrower beam focusing (thinner PSF). |\n"
